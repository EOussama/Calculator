# Calculator
---

## Description
Not the most impressive beginner project I know, I just got my head around **Visual Basic**, and I needed to do something to test what I knowso far, I worked on a web browser, and this is another experimental project to shut my doubts around this language.
I'm aiming to create a simple calculator thatdoes theabsolute basics, (_Add, substract, multiply, and devide_).
In addition to my **VB** training, this is my absolute first approach to **WPF** forms, I guess I need to wrap my head up aroundthis **XAML** thing asap!
